# Ryu Hoshi
## About project
Hi!

This website has been developed for an experienced martial artist from 'Street Fighter' - Ryu Hoshi, who wants to market his personal brand. The aim is to present the essential information about Ryu in order to let potential customers know him better. Here, I used an already existing [draft](https://github.com/binary-studio-academy/stage-2-how-developers-work/tree/master/ryu) to fill it with the Ryu's life experience info, added some own features making the page more attractive and live.
